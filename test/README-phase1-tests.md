   - GPU-intensive jobs are placed on GPU-rich nodes

3. **Dynamic Load Balancing**
   - Workloads are distributed evenly across nodes
   - Load balancing responds to node failures
   - Load balancing respects resource constraints

### Resource Optimization Test Scenarios
1. **Dynamic Allocation Adjustment**
   - Underutilized jobs have resources reduced
   - Overutilized jobs have resources increased
   - Adjustments respect minimum/maximum limits

2. **Memory Optimization**
   - Memory fragmentation is detected and resolved
   - Memory allocation is optimized for efficiency
   - Memory pressure triggers optimization actions

3. **Performance-Driven Scheduling**
   - Jobs are scheduled based on performance profiles
   - Performance metrics influence scheduling decisions
   - Performance tracking provides actionable insights

### Monitoring Improvements Test Scenarios
1. **Real-time Metrics Collection**
   - Metrics are collected at specified intervals
   - Metrics accuracy is maintained under load
   - Metrics collection doesn't impact job performance

2. **Performance Tracking**
   - Job performance is tracked throughout execution
   - Performance anomalies are detected
   - Performance trends are analyzed

3. **Alerting System**
   - Critical conditions trigger alerts
   - Alert severity levels are respected
   - Alert response times meet requirements

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Integration Tests Fail**
   - Ensure Kind cluster is running: `kind get clusters`
   - Check Chainsaw installation: `chainsaw version`
   - Verify test manifests are valid: `kubectl apply --dry-run=client -f test/chainsaw/tests/`

2. **Performance Benchmarks Fail**
   - Check Go version: `go version`
   - Ensure sufficient system resources
   - Run benchmarks with verbose output: `go test -v -bench=. -benchmem`

3. **Monitoring Tests Fail**
   - Verify metrics endpoint is accessible
   - Check monitoring configuration
   - Ensure alerting system is properly configured

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Debug integration tests
chainsaw test --config test/chainsaw/configs/ci.yaml test/chainsaw/tests/enhanced-scheduling/ --verbose

# Debug performance benchmarks
